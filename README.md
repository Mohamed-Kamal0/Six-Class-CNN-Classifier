# Six Categories Image Classification using CNN 🖼️🤖

A deep learning project that classifies images into six distinct categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of image dataset for training and testing.
- CNN architecture for high accuracy image classification.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss graphs.
- Prediction on new unseen images.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
- Six categories of images (e.g., [list categories here if available]).
- Data split into **training** and **testing** sets.

## 📊 Model Architecture
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
- Fully connected dense layers for classification.
- Softmax activation for multi-class output.

## 📸 Example Output
- Training accuracy/loss graphs.
- Sample predictions with actual vs predicted labels.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
